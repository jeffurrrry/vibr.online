            The threat regarding the coronavirus has continually worsened as the situation becomes all the more dire. So much so, that the disease has been deemed an episdemic, instigating widespread fear and panic. The interactive model on this website hopes to further spread awareness of the current situation regarding the disease and have people become aware of the statistical risks of contracting the disease within their geographic location. Modelling a similar map created by researchers at John Hopkins University, we hope to reach a further audience with this information. It is imperative that people do not panic from such a situation and we hope that educating the general public regarding this breakout would quell such disorder.
