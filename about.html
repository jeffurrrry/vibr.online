            The threat regarding the Coronavirus has continually worsened as the situation becomes all the more dire. 
            It is to the extent that the disease has been deemed an epidemic, instigating widespread fear and panic on a global scale. 
            The interactive model on this website hopes to further spread awareness of the 
            current situation regarding the disease and have people become aware of the statistical 
            risks of contracting the disease within their geographic location. Modelling a similar map created by 
            researchers at John Hopkins University, we hope to reach a further audience with this information. 
            It is imperative that the general public does not panic from such a situation and we hope that 
            educating people in regards to this breakout would quell such disorder.
